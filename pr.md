## Bounty Solution Submission

### Problem Statement
This bounty solves the challenge of creating a reliable Pomodoro timer web application with the critical requirement of background audio notifications that work even when the Chrome browser tab is minimized or in the background. The main technical challenge was overcoming Chrome's autoplay policies and background tab throttling to ensure consistent audio notifications during focus sessions.

### Solution Approach
I implemented a single-file HTML application using Web Audio API instead of traditional HTML5 audio for superior background reliability. Key technical decisions included:

- **Web Audio API**: Programmatically generated chime sounds for zero external dependencies
- **Absolute Timing System**: Using `Date.now()` timestamps to prevent timing drift during background tab throttling
- **Dual Permission System**: Integrating both Web Audio API and Notifications API for comprehensive browser permission handling
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern, accessible design with comprehensive input validation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation when permissions are denied

### Technical Implementation
- **Package Manager**: N/A - Single HTML file with embedded CSS/JS (no build process required)
- **Database Setup**: N/A - No database required for this client-side application
- **Environment Variables**: N/A - Fully self-contained application
- **Build Process**: N/A - Ready-to-use single HTML file

### Testing Evidence

- **Test Coverage**: 
  - Background audio functionality with tab switching
  - Browser permission request flow (allow/deny scenarios)
  - Input validation (negative numbers, zero, large values, non-numeric)
  - Keyboard accessibility (spacebar controls, tab navigation)
  - Timer accuracy during background operation
  - Visual feedback and error handling


- **Critical Flows Tested**:
  - User enables audio permissions → Browser prompt appears → Permission granted/denied
  - Set 1 minute timer → Switch to different tab → Audio notification plays at completion.Meets the criteria specified for (1-999)
  - Invalid input handling → Clear error messages displayed
  - Timer pause/resume functionality during active sessions
  - Accessibility flow using keyboard-only navigation

- **Test Results**: All core functionality verified working in Chrome desktop. Background audio notifications trigger reliably when tab is inactive, which was the primary technical challenge.

### Demo Evidence
- **Live Demo**: The application runs entirely client-side from a single HTML file. Deployed on  github pages - simply open `https://neshjesse.github.io/pomodoro/` in Chrome browser.

### Setup Instructions
Step-by-step instructions to see how the code runs:
1. Visit 'https://neshjesse.github.io/pomodoro/'
2. Click "Enable Sound Notifications" button when prompted and confirm your machine is not muted and has a good volume precentage
3. Allow permissions when Chrome shows the notification permission dialog
4. Enter desired timer duration in minutes (1-999)
5. Click "Start" to begin your focus session
6. Switch to other tabs/applications - audio notification will play when timer completes

### Database Setup
No database setup required - this is a client-side only application with no data persistence needs.

### Architectural Decisions

**1. Web Audio API over HTML5 Audio**
- Reason: Better reliability for background tab audio playback
- Trade-off: Slightly more complex implementation, but critical for core requirement

**2. Single HTML File Architecture**
- Reason: Meets requirement for no external dependencies
- Trade-off: Larger file size, but easier deployment and distribution

**3. Programmatic Sound Generation**
- Reason: Eliminates need for audio files, maintains zero dependencies
- Trade-off: More complex audio code, but creates pleasant multi-harmonic chime

**4. Absolute Timestamp Timing**
- Reason: Immune to Chrome's background tab throttling
- Trade-off: Slightly more complex calculations, but ensures accuracy

**5. Dual Notification System**
- Reason: Audio + browser notifications provide redundancy
- Trade-off: More permission complexity, but better user experience

### Bun/Yarn Justification
Package manager not applicable - this solution uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with no build process, dependencies, or compilation step required. The single-file architecture meets the bounty requirement for minimal external dependencies while ensuring maximum compatibility and ease of deployment.
